# React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, ESLint rules, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

@vitejs/plugin-react uses Babel (or oxc when used in rolldown-vite) for Fast Refresh
@vitejs/plugin-react-swc uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler
The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see this documentation.
Tailwind CSS
This project uses Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling, enabling rapid UI development with a responsive and modern design approach.
Tailwind is already configured in the project via tailwind.config.js and imported in index.css.
For more details, check the Tailwind CSS documentation.

##Expanding the ESLint configuration
If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the TS template for information on how to integrate TypeScript and typescript-eslint in your project.
